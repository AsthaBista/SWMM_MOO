This is a part of my PhD project on using multi-objective optimization for planning of Nature-based solutions in urban stormwater management.
I performed Monte Carlo analysis using random 150 different LID scenarios. Then I calculated water quantity, water quality, environmental and economic indicators. 
I then used correlation analysis, PCA and cluster analysis to analyze and compare the indicators involved in the process.
For determination of environmental indicators such as Urban Cooling and Urban Nature Access,I have used Jupyter Notebooks in ArcGIS for simpler use.
