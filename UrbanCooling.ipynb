    "Here, I am calculating the values for a buffer area of 100 m, which is an assumption of maximum cooling distance. The reason for doing this is that entities such as urban cooling is highly dependent on the surrounding few meters. There may be a difference in opinion in this case, since while calculating runoff, we are not consdering inflow runoff from the surrounding, instead we focus only an influx from the rainfall. However, I think the influence of the surrounding is much more prominent for these socioenvironmental variables, and they should be considereed. \n",
    "Cooling distance recommended by InVEST Mnaual is 450m , but (Zawadzka et al., 2021) found that this distance overestimates the influence of greenspaces in urban areas. Therefore, they recommend 100m.  Denser urban areas require shorter coolking distance.\n",
